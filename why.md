# Why?

Why am I rebuilding a perfectly working lab? Because I was getting tired of dorking with
Linux. I want to get stuff done, and tweaking system libraries
isn't cutting it anymore.

## What did it used to be?

My first iteration of the lab looked like a yard-sale lab. I had
6 half-height desktop machines that I'd bought from Woot for about $40 each
running Linux for a task, and was using 2 Google Search boxes (more on them later) as 
the beefy ElasticSearch boxes.

This worked, but took way too much of my time.
