# Hacker Hegemony

About a year ago, in a fit of revolutionary zeal, I read a book called [The Hegemony How-To](https://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-How-Radicals-Jonathan-Smucker/dp/1849352542). 

It did not change my life. 

Two things did stick out to me, though:
 1. This book is in dire need of an editor. Seriously, if you read it (and I do recommend it), be patient with the 
 author's somewhat opaque language. This is a book aimed at people who are comfortable with academic political 
 papers. That wasn't me, so I found some parts of it slow going.
 2. There were a number of places where I could have substituted "hacker community" for "political movement" in the book
 and his thoughts and comments would have been just as accurate. This is not necessarily a good thing.

 
One of the central points of the book is that political movements over time risk becoming more than just a group of people
  tied together by a political goal. The risk is that they become "identities" to their members. When that happens, members stop 
  seeing themselves as "a regular person who doesn't like war" and instead begin to see themselves as "an anti-war protestor". 
  Membership in the group becomes part of the participant's identity. In the short term this is good, 
  because people who strongly identify with the cause will volunteer more of their time to the cause. In the long term,
  though, it causes some major problems for the group.

First, the actions taken by an identity-based group can easily become disconnected from the stated goal of the group. 
Instead of furthering the groups stated goals, identity member's actions serve to prove their dedication to the group and
to reinforce their identity as a member of the group. For example, anti-war protestors used to chain themselves to 
random military buildings, and would, unsurprisingly, get arrested for doing so. Why would they do this? The Pentagon 
didn't care if a single depot in the middle of Pennsylvania was unavailable for a couple hours. So the act of "sacrifice"
 by the protestor didn't have any material impact on providing supplies for the war, and didn't change the minds of an 
 indifferent public. So why do it? They do it to prove to the other members of the group they're so dedicated to the 
 cause that they will sacrifice their own well-being (and future employment possibilities). Being arrested solidifies
 the member's identity as someone who is "an anti-war protestor", and not just "a regular person" anymore.

Second, identity-based groups risk becoming very inward-facing, and may appear hostile to new 
members. The group may even reject new members as not dedicated enough to the cause until the new person
proves themselves in some way (like chaining themselves to meaningless buildings). This can also show up 
as gate-keeping and as special language or terms that the group insists on using differently than the 
rest of society. All of these behaviors leads to the group talking mostly to itself. Members spend time
convincing themselves of the rightness of their ideas, but don't reach the people who could change anything. 

This hostility (whether deliberate or accidental) to new members also leads to group membership stagnating, 
which will eventually kill the group. Some level of turnover of the group is going to happen naturally, and if the
group is too hostile to new members, new members won't be available to pick up when existing members 
move on.
 
This sounds awfully familiar. 

Substitute "privacy researcher" or "hacker" for "anti-war protestor", and something meaningless like 
"leaving Facebook" for chaining yourself to a building, the security/hacker world sounds an awful lot like the 
identity based problems that Mr. Smucker talks about. 

Special, in-group terminology? I offer you the word "Cracker". No one cares about the word "cracker" as distinct from "hacker"...except us.
