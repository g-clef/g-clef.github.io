# Hacker Hegemony

I've been working in the Information Security space for over 20 years, and in all that time I never really felt 
like I belonged in the "hacker" community.

I do all kinds of things that, on the surface, make it seem like I'd fit right in: I run a bunch of computers in my 
basement, I've learned how to pick locks because it sounded like fun, I scanned the entire IPv4 internet a few times 
for fun...and yet, when I'd go to hacker/security conferences, I always felt like an outsider.

For years I chalked that up to a mix of imposter syndrome and my being pretty anti-social. 

But then, in a fit of revolutionary zeal, I read a 
book called [The Hegemony How-To](https://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-How-Radicals-Jonathan-Smucker/dp/1849352542) by 
Jonathan Smucker. If you haven't heard of it, it's a book by one of the central figures in the Occupy Wall Street 
movement, about what he learned from that movement and what he thought left-wing political movements overall could 
learn from Occupy's successes and failures.

It did not change my life.

It did, however, strike me that there were a lot of parallels with the "hacker" community.

Before I dive into those, a warning: This book is in dire need of an editor. If you read it (and I do recommend it), 
be patient with Smucker's word choices. This is a book aimed at people who are comfortable with academic political 
writing. That wasn't me, so I found parts of it slow going and opaque. If you fight through those, there are some good
nuggets of insight in there.
 
One of the central points of the book is that political movements over time risk becoming more than just a group of people
 tied together by a political goal: they risk becoming part of their member's identities. When that happens, members stop 
 seeing themselves as a regular person, and start seeing themselves as a "group" member. For example, a peace-loving
 person would stop being "a regular person who doesn't like war" and instead become "an anti-war 
 protestor". Membership in the group becomes part of the participant's identity. In the short term this is good: people 
 who strongly identify with the group will volunteer more of their time to the group. In the long term, though, it causes 
 major problems.

First, people whose identity is tied to the group will start taking actions that are disconnected from the 
stated goal of the group. If your identity is tied to being part of the group, your actions will bias towards 
 reinforcing that identity, proving to yourself and others that your choice was right. Instead of furthering the 
 group's stated goals, identity member's actions serve to prove their dedication to the group and to reinforce 
 their identity as a member of the group. 

For example, anti-war protestors used to chain themselves to random military buildings, and would, unsurprisingly, get 
arrested for doing so. Seen from the outside, these acts seemed crazy. The Pentagon didn't care if a single depot in 
the middle of Pennsylvania was unavailable for a couple hours, So the act of "sacrifice" by the protestor didn't 
have any material impact on providing supplies for war, and didn't change the minds of an indifferent public. So why 
did the anti-war protestors do it? Their stated goal was to "raise awareness", but their actions were rarely reported
on by the press, so that claim rang hollow. Smucker claims that they really did it to prove to themselves and the other 
members of the group just how dedicated they were to the group. Getting arrested would prove to the group that
they will sacrifice their own well-being (and future employment possibilities). 
Being arrested solidifies the member's identity as someone who is "an anti-war protestor", and not just "a regular 
person" anymore.

Second, identity-based groups risk becoming very inward-facing, and may appear hostile to new members. The group may 
even reject new members as not dedicated enough to the cause until the new person proves themselves in some way 
(like chaining themselves to meaningless buildings). This can also show up as gate-keeping and as special language 
or terms that the group insists on using differently than the rest of society. All of these behaviors leads to the 
group talking mostly to itself. Members spend time convincing themselves of the rightness of their ideas, but don't 
reach the people who could change anything. 

This hostility (whether deliberate or accidental) to new members also leads to group membership stagnating, 
which will eventually kill the group. Some level of turnover is going to happen naturally, and if the
group is too hostile to outsiders, new members won't be available to pick up when existing members 
move on.
 
As I read this, it all sounded awfully familiar. 

This was exactly what I felt as I walked around at hacker conferences.
