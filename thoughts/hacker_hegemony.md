# Hacker Hegemony

I've been working in the Information Security space for over 20 years, and in all that time I never really felt 
like I belonged in the hacker community.

I do all kinds of things that, on the surface, make it seem like I'd fit right in: I run a cluster of computers in my 
basement, I've learned how to pick locks because it sounded like fun, I scanned the entire IPv4 internet a few times 
for fun, I politically agree with the EFF (mostly). I still felt like an outsider at hacker/security conferences. I
 didn't feel superior or inferior to the folks in the hacker community...it just felt like a subtly-different
language was being spoken by all the people around me, one where I knew all the words, but the grammar was enough
different that I just didn't get it.

For years, I chalked that up to a mix of imposter syndrome and my being pretty anti-social. 

Last year, in a fit of revolutionary zeal, I read a book called 
[The Hegemony How-To](https://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-How-Radicals-Jonathan-Smucker/dp/1849352542) by 
Jonathan Smucker. If you haven't heard of it, it's a book by one of the figures in the Occupy Wall Street 
movement, about what he learned from that movement and what he thought left-wing political movements overall could 
learn from Occupy's successes and failures.

As I dug through it, it struck me that there were a lot of parallels between his comments on Occupy and the 
hacker community, and it helped me understand the overall hacker world a little better. 

Before I dive into this, a warning: If you read it - and I do recommend it - be patient with Smucker's word choices. 
This is a book aimed at people who are comfortable with academic political writing. That wasn't me, by a long shot,so I 
found parts of it hard to read. If you fight through those, there are some good nuggets of insight in there.
 
One of the central points of the book is that movements, political in his case, risk becoming more than just a 
group of people tied together by a political goal - they risk becoming part of their member's identities. As people
get more involved in the movement, they stop seeing themselves as a regular person and start seeing themselves through 
the lens of the group itself. For example, a peace-loving person would stop being "a regular person who doesn't like 
war" and instead become "an anti-war protestor". Membership in the group becomes part of the participant's identity. 

In the short term having people with a strong identification with the group can be helpful, especially for upstart 
groups: people who strongly identify with the group will volunteer more of their time to the group. In the long term, 
though, it causes major problems.

The first problem it causes is that people whose identity is tied to the group will start taking actions to reinforce 
that identity, even if it doesn't further the group's stated goals. For example, Smucker talks about working with 
protest groups in DC, and how the protest actions gradually disconnected from their actual effectiveness, and instead
focused on how they reflected your commitment to the group:
> Coming to a protest was good. Taking an arrest was better. But the pinacle of resistance was to physically hammer on 
> part of the arsenal of empire. I reflected on how some people granted me more respect and attention ... the further I 
> traveled down this established tactical path. The effect was that newcomers were socially encouraged to imitate rather
> than to innovate and be critical.

But they weren't considering how those actions looked to the people they were trying to actually influence (the general
public who kept voting for the politicians that enabled the system they protested against). 
> Often the only people who learn of the actions are a small number of military personnel and the small, 
> already-sympathetic readership of these commmunities' newsletters and websites. 

...

> dramatic and temporary disruptions of the dominant culture's representations (e.g., smashing up a business district)
> have sometimes been reflected back to millions of people through the mass media, but the public's perceived meaning
> of the action differs severely from the actor' intended or self-understood meaning.


The second problem that identity causes is that identity-based groups become very inward-facing, and may 
appear hostile to new members. This can also show up as gate-keeping and as special language 
or terms that the group insists on using differently than the rest of society. All of these behaviors lead to the 
group talking mostly to itself. Smucker quotes Frederick Miller:
> members may develop such strong choesion among themselves that outsiders become unwelcome. In prolonged interaction,
> a group may develop an ideology that is internally coherent but virtually unintelligible to recruits and outsiders 
> who do not share all of the member's assumptions.
...
> such groups have little chance of growing or increasing their influence. Most strikingly, they may lose interest in 
> such things, contenting themselves with maintaining their encapsulated existence.
 
As I read this, it actually made my disconnect from the hacker community make a lot more sense to me.

For example, I could never understand why cons had so many talks about being a hacker or about the hacker community. 
I loved the talks that showed me something new, even if it was just new to me, and that kind of learning is what pulled
me into security in the first place. But the hacker community talks always felt like navel-gazing to me. I'd attend 
 them occasionally, and really fail to understand why this talk was chosen over something else
 
Seen through the lens of what Smucker is talking about, the talks and the general vibe at hacker cons makes a lot 
 more sense to me. For people for whom being a hacker is a part of their identity, these sorts of talks are important. 
 Since I didn't feel like part of the group, those talks just amplified my feeling of not belonging.

I think this idea of identity also helps explain some of the really weird disconnects between infosec actions and goals.
For me, the overall goal of infosec/hacking community is to make the internet a safter place for everyone, while
 also maintaining its freedom. It's a push/pull goal, but those are the two variables that (I think) infosec is trying
 to maximize: safety + freedom. 
 
But the community started turning inward talking to ourselves. For example 
[This thread by Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1323565835961556992) highlights just how the security
world's recommendations are seen from the outside. While some of the comments in the thread are obviously 
trolling and shit-posting for fun, there's a hard kernel of truth in them - that the recommendations for being "secure"
are routinely ignored or utterly impractical when used in the real world. 

There's a lot of discussion in the hacker world that I can see about doing more outreach, and smacking down the 
gatekeeping and hostility. On the other hand, a great deal of damage has already been done. Very visible people 
like Corey Quinn (who I quoted above) have publicly stated "I don't go to security conferences because they're 
toxic shitholes...there are spectacular tech talks, but the culture is horrifying."  [here](https://youtu.be/bQU_29Cglyk?t=2127)
I'm probably never going to feel like I'm part of the group, but I at least understand it better.
