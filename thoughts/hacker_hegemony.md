# Hacker Hegemony

I've been working in the Information Security space for over 20 years, and in all that time I never really felt 
like I belonged in the hacker community.

I do all kinds of things that, on the surface, make it seem like I'd fit right in: I run a cluster of computers in my 
basement, I've learned how to pick locks because it sounded like fun, I scanned the entire IPv4 internet a few times 
for fun, I politically agree with the EFF (mostly). I still felt like an outsider at hacker/security conferences.

For years, I chalked that up to a mix of imposter syndrome and my being pretty anti-social. 

Last year, in a fit of revolutionary zeal, I read a book called 
[The Hegemony How-To](https://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-How-Radicals-Jonathan-Smucker/dp/1849352542) by 
Jonathan Smucker. If you haven't heard of it, it's a book by one of the figures in the Occupy Wall Street 
movement, about what he learned from that movement and what he thought left-wing political movements overall could 
learn from Occupy's successes and failures.

As I dug through it, it struck me that there were a lot of parallels between his comments on Occupy, and the 
hacker community.

Before I dive into those, a warning: Hegemony How-To is a book is in dire need of an editor. If you read it - and I do 
recommend it - be patient with Smucker's word choices. This is a book aimed at people who are comfortable with academic 
political writing. That wasn't me, so I found parts of it slow going and opaque. If you fight through those, there are 
some good nuggets of insight in there.
 
One of the central points of the book is that movements, political in his interest, risk becoming more than just a 
group of people tied together by a political goal - they risk becoming part of their member's identities. Members stop 
 seeing themselves as a regular person, and start seeing themselves through the lens of the group itself. 
 For example, a peace-loving person would stop being "a regular person who doesn't like war" and instead become 
 "an anti-war protestor". Membership in the group becomes part of the participant's identity. In the short term this 
 can be helpful: people who strongly identify with the group will volunteer more of their time to the group. In the 
 long term, though, it causes major problems.

The first problem it causes is that people whose identity is tied to the group will start taking actions that are 
disconnected from the stated goal of the group. People whose identities are that closely wrapped up in the group will
bias towards acts reinforcing that identity, even instead of furthering the group's stated goals. 

For example, anti-war protestors used to chain themselves to military buildings, and would, unsurprisingly, get 
arrested for doing so. Seen from the outside, these acts seemed crazy. The Pentagon didn't care if a single depot in 
the middle of Pennsylvania was unavailable for a couple hours, so the act of defiance and arrest by the protestor didn't 
have any material impact on providing supplies for war, and didn't change the minds of an indifferent public. 

So why did the anti-war protestors do it? Their stated goal was often to "raise awareness", but their actions were 
rarely reported by the press, so that claim rang hollow. Smucker claims that they really did it to prove to 
themselves and the other members of the group just how dedicated they were to the cause. Getting arrested would prove
to the group that they would sacrifice their own well-being (and future employment possibilities) to the cause. Being 
arrested solidified the member's identity as someone who is "an anti-war protestor", and not just a regular person 
anymore. The fact that this sacrifice did nothing to further the anti-war effort was overlooked.

The second problem this identity causes is that identity-based groups become very inward-facing, and may 
appear hostile to new members. This can also show up as gate-keeping and as special language 
or terms that the group insists on using differently than the rest of society. All of these behaviors lead to the 
group talking mostly to itself. Members spend time convincing each other of the rightness of their ideas, 
but don't reach the people who could actually implement those ideas.
 
As I read this, it all sounded awfully familiar. 

The hacker community (or at least the part of the community I was exposed to at cons) sounded just like this. People
doing things to prove their worth to the community, inward-facing discussions ()

For example, I could never understand why there were so many talks about being a hacker or about the hacker community. 
I loved the talks that showed me something new, even if it was just new to me, but the hacker community talks always 
felt like navel-gazing. Seen through the lens of what Smucker is talking about, the talks and the general vibe at 
hacker cons makes a lot more sense to me.
