## The ubiquitous blog

I've recently started taking more effective notes on my home projects
and home lab, and in the interest of helping people not make the same 
mistakes I did, I decided to start sharing the stuff I've done here. Over time this will
grow to cover lots of stuff, but documenting the work is a task in and of itself.

* [The lab](/home_lab_setup.md) - this is how I've set up my home lab, including the projects that are running
on it, and how I built it.
