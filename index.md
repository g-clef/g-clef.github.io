## The obligatory blog

Like a lot of tech folks, I've got a home lab. It's not the biggest, fanciest lab, but it's mine. I recently rebuilt it
(something that feels a bit like the nerd equivalent of dorking with the engine of a car in the garage), and I 
decided to start taking more notes on what I was doing in the interest of helping people not make the 
same mistakes I did. These are those notes.

I'm just some guy, really. I've been doing Infosec since the first .com boom, which mostly just means I've watched my 
401k get nuked 3 times (as of this writing...could be more by the time you read this).
