## The obligatory blog

Last year I made the mistake of deciding to rebuild my home lab. My home lab isn't the biggest or 
fanciest, but it has just enough idiosyncracies, and life has caught up to me enough, that the rebuild process turned
into a saga of its own. This wouldn't have been the first time a rebuild turned into a Star-Wars-level quest, but 
*this* time I took notes. 

* [but why?](/why.md) - Why I rebuilt it, and what it used to be
* [hardware & OS](/lab/hardware.md) - What hardware I'm using, how I've got it set up, and any special OS configurations.
* [containers](/lab/lxd.md) - The container system I'm using (LXC/LXD), how I got it set up, and how I'm using it.
* [kubernetes](/lab/kubernetes.md) - How I've got kubernetes installed
* [projects](/projects/index.md) - The fun part: the actual projects I'm working on in the lab.

I'm just some guy, really. I've been doing Infosec since the first .com boom, which mostly just means I've watched my 
401k get nuked 3 times (as of this writing...could be more by the time you read this).
