## The obligatory blog

In 2019 I made a mistake - I decided to rebuild my home lab. My home lab isn't the biggest or 
fanciest lab out there, but it has just enough idiosyncracies, and life has caught up to me enough, that the rebuild 
process turned into a saga of its own. This wouldn't have been the first time a rebuild turned into an RPG-level 
quest, but *this* time was different - this time I took notes. These are those notes.

* [but why?](/why.md) - Why I rebuilt it, and what it used to be
* [hardware & OS](/lab/hardware.md) - What hardware I'm using, how I've got it set up, and any special OS configurations
* [containers](/lab/lxd.md) - The container system I'm using (LXC/LXD), how I got it set up
* [kubernetes](/lab/kubernetes.md) - How I've got kubernetes installed
* [projects](/projects/index.md) - The fun part: the actual projects I'm working on in the lab.
* [thoughts](/thoughts/index.md) - Random other thoughts

I'm just some guy. I've been doing Infosec since the first .com boom, which just means I've watched my 
401k get nuked 3 times (as of this writing...could be more by the time you read this).
