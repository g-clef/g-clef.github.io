## The obligatory blog

In 2019 I made a mistake - I decided to rebuild my home lab. My home lab isn't the biggest or 
fanciest lab out there, but it has just enough idiosyncracies, and life has caught up to me enough, that the rebuild 
process turned into a saga of its own. This wouldn't have been the first time a rebuild turned into an RPG-level 
quest, but *this* time was different - this time I took notes. These are those notes.

- About the lab (setup, etc)
  - [but why?](/why.md) - Why I rebuilt it, and what it used to be
  - [hardware & OS](/lab/hardware.md) - What hardware I'm using, how I've got it set up, and any special OS configurations
  - [kubernetes](/lab/kubernetes.md) - How I've got kubernetes installed
  - [smb](/lab/smb.md) - Some notes on connecting to SMB shares from inside kubernetes.

- projects (the stuff I'm doing in the lab)
  - [malwarETL](/projects/malwarETL.md) - a kubernetes-based system to collect and analyse malicious software. 

- Other stuff:
  - [Hacker Hegemony](/thoughts/hacker_hegemony.md) - Thoughts from reading the Hegemony Howto, and how it
    relates to the hacker world.
  - [MythTV on a NAS](/thoughts/mythtv_nas.md) - Notes on setting up a MythTV backend on a QNAP NAS

I'm just some guy. I've been doing Infosec since the first .com boom, which just means I've watched my 
401k get nuked 3 times (as of this writing...could be more by the time you read this).
