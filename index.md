## The obligatory blog

Like a lot of tech folks, I've got a home lab. It's not the biggest, fanciest lab, but it's mine. I recently rebuilt it,
and I decided to start taking more notes on what I was doing in the interest of my own sanity, and to help people not 
make the same mistakes I did.

* [but why?](/why.md) - Why I rebuilt it, and what it used to be
* [lab infrastructure](/home_lab_setup.md) - How it's set up (software, hardware, etc)

I'm just some guy, really. I've been doing Infosec since the first .com boom, which mostly just means I've watched my 
401k get nuked 3 times (as of this writing...could be more by the time you read this).
